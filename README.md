git clone https://github.com/Born-ship-it/SCIQIS-2025-Project.git
cd SCIQIS-2025-Project
pip install .
</code></pre>

This project, Cavity QED, is a topic covered doing the course, which I drove deeper into. It has direct relation and application to quantum information science. Done by adapting and creating my own code in ipython notebooks.

## What to expect 
Of interest is the Intro_project notebook and then also Atom_Cavity and Cavity_Mirror, these notebooks should be read and ran, a few things to learn of results and physics :). 

## Course relevant/reflecting stuff

Made good use of the QuTiP library for simulating time evolution of Hamiltonians using master equation solver, doing the course I have finished doing atom-cavity, the Jaynes-Cumming model, and cavity-mirror, Bose et al. PRA 56, 4175 (1997). Also used core scientific computing packages for Python: Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib.

I cover computing topics from the course, such as profiling and speeding up my code (timing, line profiling, arrays vs. loops, caching, numexpr, Numba, arrays), visually the physics (Interactive visualisation with ipywidgets), and data analysis. 

Also was introduced to Github, using basic version control with git and managing a small the project.

Adapted python modules with ipython notebook using ipynb.fs.full.file_name to import functions from Cavity_Mirror_func over in Cavity_Mirror.
